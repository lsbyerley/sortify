Sortify 1.0
============

I was looking for a simple, lightweight table sorting script and everything I came across had way too many features than what I was looking for. I then decided to develop my own.

Sortify Features:
1. Set a default sort order (asc or desc)
2. Set a default column to sort
3. Adds a "sortcell" class to the sorted <td> cells to highlight them

For now, the features are all I need, but I may add more in the future.

This is my first jQuery plugin. If you have any recommendations, concerns, or notice any errors, please let me know.
