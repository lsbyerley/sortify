Sortify v1.0
============

I was looking for a simple, lightweight table sorting script and everything I came across had way too many features than what I was looking for. I then decided to develop my own.

Sortify Features:<br>
1. Set a default sort order (asc or desc)<br>
2. Set a default column to sort<br>
3. Adds a "sortcell" class to the sorted cells to highlight them<br>

For now, the features are all I need, but I may add more in the future.

This is my first jQuery plugin. If you have any recommendations, concerns, or notice any errors, please let me know.
